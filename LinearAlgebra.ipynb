    "\n",
    "In Numpy, Vectors and Matrices are objects of type'ndarray's. Typically just called 'array's when describing them.\n",
    "Numpy arrays can be created in several ways. There is a mapping directly between a Python list and a Numpy array. Sometimes Numpy will implicitly cast a list to a numpy array, but not always. The following are some of the array creation routines that are global to the numpy package.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't know linear algebra at all or only a little, for the flying car program  you don't need to know things like 'how to traponse a matrix', 'how to do a dot product', 'how to multiple two matrices', 'how to invert a matrix', etc. Numpy will do if for you. You just need to know when to use what, the behavior of the functions, their constraints and what certain error outputs mean.\n",

    "\n",
    "NOTE : numpy function try to optimize data usage by sometimes returning a 'view' of an array rather than modifying the original array or returning a new array. Usually this doesn't matter and you can use the 'view' just like its an array. But be aware if you change the original, the view will change too. This is unfamiliar to those used to a more functional style where mutation is frowned on and functions always return new objects. Some functions modify the array itself, and some return a new array. So if it matters, check the specific documentation.\n",
