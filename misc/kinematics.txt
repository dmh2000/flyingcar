kinematics constraints:
    ignoring mass or forces
    based on geometry of environment

differential constraints:
    based on derivative of state

holonomic: no differential constraints

quasi-holonomic: seem to have no differential constraints
    can move any direction

dynamic constraints : form of differential constraints
    forces and mass


examples:

can tolerate any crosswind but can't fly upwind
    x-dot > 0   (velocity is x direction is > 0)

acceleration constraints
