goal : estimate x_hat from unknown state x

estimators have 3 things
1. measurement model H
2. make m measurements y of true state x
   y = Hx + v  (new state if H is perfect, i.e. v = 0)
3. mathematical model of noise
    v = 0 mean gaussian with covariance R
    v ~ N(0,R)

Methods
-------------
Least Squares
    measurements come in at once
    measurement model is nxm matrix
    maps 1 true state to m measurements
    model is linear

Recursive
    measurements come in one at a time
    is linear
    is a vector
    maps 1 true state to 1 measurement

Non-Linear Least Squares
    measurement come in one at a time
    model is an arbitrary function to map true state to measurement

Vehicle must be stationary for these to work

Variables
x the unknown state vector
H the linear measurement model
v the measurement noise from N(0,R)
R the covariance of v
m the number of measurements made
n the state vector x
y_hat the actual noisy state measurements

Least Squares
    assumptions
        stationary vehicle
        measurements all at once
        H is linear (y = Ax + b)
    use for stationary calibration

    y = Hx + v
    x is constant state vector of length n
    y = vector of measurements
    v = unknown error vector , use a gaussian N(0,R)
    H = measurement matrix projects state into measurement space
    use maximum likelihood estimator

Maximum Likelihood Estimator
x = unknown state vector
y~ is actual noisy measurements
H is linear measurement model
v = noise where N(0,R)
R = covariance of noise
m = number of measurements
n = length of state vector x
x_hat = (HT*T)-1*HT*y~

x = [a,b]  unknown state vector
yi = at + b + v
y~ = Hx + v


Recursive least squares
    Maximum A Posteriori Estimate
    make m measurements y of unknown state x such that y = Hx + v
    x = unknown state vector
    y~ is actual noisy measurements
    H is linear measurement model
    v = noise where N(0,R)

    p(x) = prior ~ N(x_hat[0],Q[o])
    1. find PDF of p(x|y)
       P(x|y) = p(x)(p(y|x)/p(y)
       = aN(Hx,R) @ N(x[0], Q[0])
    2. choose X-hat as MAP
        p(x_hat,y~) = N(x_hat[1],Q[1])
        Q1 = (Qo^-1 + H.T * R^-1 * H) ^-1
        x_hat[1] = x_hat[0] + Q[1]*H.T * R^(y~ - H*x_hat[0])

Non-Linear Least Squares
    measurements = h(x) are nonlinear
    h(x) = h(h_hat0) + Hx_hat0 * (x - x_hat0)
    1. construct the jacobian (of derivatives of h
    2. compute posterior covariance Q1 (see recursive notebook)
    3. compute posterior mean esimate (x_hat1)
